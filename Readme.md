**Project Title:** AdoptNest  

---

**Project Overview:**  
AdoptNest helps adopters find pets and owners list pets for adoption. Users can browse, search, and filter pets; owners can create listings; and adoption requests can be sent and managed end-to-end.

---

**Key Features:**  
1. **User Uploads:**  
   - Upload a selfie to analyze facial features.  
   - Enter a short description of personality traits.  

2. **Pet Matching Algorithm:**  
   - Use a database of celebrity pets and their unique traits (e.g., Taylor Swift's cat, Paris Hilton's chihuahua).  
   - Match users with a pet based on vibes and characteristics.  

3. **Result Page:**  
   - Display the matched pet with a fun description and an image.  
   - Include a "Share My Match" button for social media sharing.  

4. **Bonus Features (Optional):**  
   - Add animations or effects while matching.  
   - Include a “Learn More” button to explore the pet’s background and celebrity owner.

**Tech Stack:**  

- **Frontend:**  
  - Framework: React.js or Vue.js.  
  - Styling: Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap.  
  - Image Upload and Preview: HTML5 File API with React Dropzone.  

- **Backend:**  
  - Language: Node.js (Express.js) or Python (Flask/Django).  
  - Database: MongoDB for storing users, pets, and adoption requests.  
  - APIs: Integrate with facial recognition APIs like Azure Face API or AWS Rekognition for selfie analysis.  

- **Other Tools:**  
  - Cloud Storage: AWS S3 or Firebase for storing uploaded images.  
  - Deployment: Vercel (frontend) and Render/Heroku (backend).
